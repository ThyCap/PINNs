# Describe project

# TODO List:
OK -- "Tensorize loss" : generate loss tensor on domain
OK -- Automate loss heatmap generation
OK -- Plot heatmap with eventual holes 
-- Dashboard creation?
OK -- Add labels to axes
OK-- Add x and y vals to axes
OK -- Create Top and Bottom BCs
-- Plot N_u and N_f points on graph
-- Evolution plot on loss_bc and loss_pde
-- Statement on number of iterations
-- Understand why it stops

# Lessons learned: 
-- NN will optimize to a sharp second derivative. Possible hypotheses:
    -- 1. overfitting due to number of layers/nodes
    -- 2. Sampling points fall out of sharp points
